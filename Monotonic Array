/*
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array
is monotonic.
An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely
non-decreasing.
Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing; they simply don't increase. Similarly,
non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.
Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.
Sample Input
array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
Sample Output
true
